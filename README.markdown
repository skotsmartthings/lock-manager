# Lock Manager BETA

This BETA is provided for testing purposes.  If you are uncomfortable about figuring things out on your own, you should wait until a proper relase in the MASTER branch of this repository.

**Questions** like 'How do I install' are NOT proper questions for a beta release.

**Feedback** like 'this thing doesn't work' is highly appreciated, and will help lead to a release.


## NOTES
UNINSTALL all 1.x apps and device types before attepting an install of 2.0.  Only install this software AFTER you've already uninstalled old versions of Lock Manager.  I would recommend uninstalling instances of the app in the SmartThings IDE.
